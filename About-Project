**Bengali OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** is a powerful tool designed to extract text from images containing printed Bengali text. Whether itâ€™s a scanned document, a page from a book, or a screenshot of a newspaper, this app can accurately recognize and extract Bengali text with minimal effort.

### Key Features:

- **Versatile Input**: Works with scanned documents, book pages, newspaper screenshots, and other types of images.
- **Standalone Application**: Packaged as a Windows `.exe` file, so no need to install Python or dependencies.
- **Open-Source**: Completely free to use and modify. You can contribute to the project and improve it.

### Why Bengali OCR?

Bengali is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, but it often faces challenges in the digital world, especially in terms of accurate text recognition. This OCR tool is designed to fill that gap, providing a reliable and accessible solution for converting Bengali text in images into editable, machine-readable formats.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**: The core language used for the development of the app.
- **Tesseract OCR**: A popular open-source OCR engine used for text recognition.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and enhancing text recognition accuracy.
